# SCI-FI & MOVIES
**Sci-Fi & Movies** is a website that engages users by testing their knowledge of some of the most iconic science fiction films. Not only are fans of this subgenre welcome, but Sci-Fi & Movies also aims to promote this genre to expand it to other audiences, share relevant facts, and attempt to increase its viewership

## DESIGN

### Typography
To suit the page for a space-themed character, I've opted for the **Orbitron** typeface. It's a family of geometric and futuristic sans-serif fonts that bear resemblance to Eurostyle or Microgramma (the font used in the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_), which is, in my opinion, the most influential science fiction film in history.

## FEATURES
The Sci-Fi & Movies game is divided into 2 pages:

**THE LOG IN**: That's the first page that the visitor get access to. Basically its an introduction about what its coming next.

**THE GAME PAGE**: After the user enters their username, they are immediately taken to the beginning of the game. Here, they will encounter 10 diverse questions related to Sci-Fi and Cinema, challenging their knowledge.

### Existing Features
- __THE LOG IN PAGE__

    - __The Sci-Fi & Movies Logo and Heading__
        - Located at the top of the page, easy to see for the user and with the addition of the _Star Treck_ symbol, that helps contextualize the type of game we are about to access, being one of the most recognized sagas in the history of science fiction cinema.

    - __The Log-in Section__
        - Allows the user to input a _"Username"_ that will be used as the _"Player Name"_ to proceed with the 10 quiz game questions. As background image for the section, I've used another reference to _2001: A Space Odyssey_ by using the original drawing of the space station of the film. The drawing shows a newly launched spacecraft from the station, a fitting symbol for what is about to begin. When we press _"Let's Play"_ it will directly redirect us to the game.

    - __The Footer__
        - In the footer, I've included an iconic quote from the history of Sci-Fi Movies, sourced from _Star Wars_, to inspire and extend my best wishes to the user for the game ahead.

    - __The Score Box__
        - Right below the logo and the header, the user will find a panel where the previously chosen __"Player"__ will be displayed, along with a scoreboard that will keep track of the __"Correct"__ and __"Incorrect"__ answers. This counter will change as the questions are answered, with the correct ones marked in _green_ and the _incorrect_ ones in red.

    - __The Quiz Game Section__
        - Right after logging in on the main page, upon accessing the __Game Page__, an _alert_ once again wishes the user good luck before starting the quiz game.

        - The Quiz Game consists of 10 questions related to various details about 10 iconic science fiction movies. Each question contains 4 possible answers, of which only one is correct.
        
        When the user hovers the mouse over the different options, they light up in blue. Once the user has considered the options, with a click, they can select only one of them, which is then marked with the same blue color.
        ![Quiz]()

    - __The Check Box__
        - Here the user will find 3 buttons. The first one is the __"Check"__ button to verify if the previously selected option is _correct_ or _incorrect_. Upon clicking the button, it will light up in _green_ if the answer is correct. If the user's selected option is incorrect, it will be colored in _red_, and the correct answer will be revealed, illuminated in green.

        - The second button, __"Next!"__, will only be accessible once the user has answered the question. After answering, this button will become enabled to proceed with the next question of the game.
