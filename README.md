# SCI-FI & MOVIES
**Sci-Fi & Movies** is a website that engages users by testing their knowledge of some of the most iconic science fiction films. Not only are fans of this subgenre welcome, but Sci-Fi & Movies also aims to promote this genre to expand it to other audiences, share relevant facts, and attempt to increase its viewership

## DESIGN

### Typography
To suit the page for a space-themed character, I've opted for the **Orbitron** typeface. It's a family of geometric and futuristic sans-serif fonts that bear resemblance to Eurostyle or Microgramma (the font used in the movie _2001: A Space Odyssey_), which is, in my opinion, the most influential science fiction film in history.

## FEATURES
The Sci-Fi & Movies game is divided into 2 pages:

**THE LOG IN**: That's the first page that the visitor get access to. Basically its an introduction about what its coming next.

**THE GAME PAGE**: After the user enters their username, they are immediately taken to the beginning of the game. Here, they will encounter 10 diverse questions related to Sci-Fi and Cinema, challenging their knowledge.

### Existing Features
- __The Sci-Fi & Movies Logo and Heading__
    - Located at the top of the page, easy to see for the user and with the addition of the _Star Treck_ symbol, that helps contextualize the type of game we are about to access, being one of the most recognized sagas in the history of science fiction cinema.

- __The Log-in Section__
    - Allows the user to input a _"Username"_ that will be used as the _"Player Name"_ to proceed with the 10 quiz game questions. As background image for the section, I've used another reference to _2001: A Space Odyssey_ by using the original drawing of the space station of the film. The drawing shows a newly launched spacecraft from the station, a fitting symbol for what is about to begin. When we press _"Let's Play"_ it will directly redirect us to the game.
