            <p>If we talk about sci-fi, it's impossible not to mention Kubrick's masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey," a film that influenced all the sci-fi films that came afterwards. Could you tell us in which year it was released?</p>

            <h2>Blade Runner</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/blade-runner.jpg" alt="Blade Runner Poster">
            <p>It's quite strange to talk about Blade Runner nowadays as an underrated science fiction film, but it was. There were few critics after its release in 1982 who praised Ridley Scott's proposal. Over time, the film grew in popularity to the point of becoming iconic, receiving a new reinterpretation in recent years. But do you know which director brought this classic of "cyberpunk" aesthetics back to the big screen?</p>

            <p>It's evident that Ridley Scott played a crucial role in shaping science fiction cinema, particularly in the 1980s. Besides Blade Runner, he was the mastermind behind 'Alien,' setting the stage for it to evolve into a full-fledged saga. Can you identify the lead actress in the first three films?</p>
